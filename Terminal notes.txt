/ root directory
~ home directory (whatever user is logged in)

Commands
	pwd - "print working directory" tells you where you are in absolute path
	ls - "list" lists all files in the directory you are in
		can have a flag behind it to list something else other than where you are
		have dashes in front of them
		can have multiple by listing them in successon behind, can be shortcutted with one dash
			-a : lists all files, including hidden ones, in current directory
			-l : gives more info about each item in folder
				to combine, -a -l or -al
	clear - clears screen
	cd - "change directory" type cd followed by the directory or a path to the directory
		cd "name of directory"
		case sensitive, need correct spelling
		can have more behind it to move in different directions
			cd .. moves to one directory up
			. is current directory
	open - opens file using default application or named folder
	man - describes a command
	      when you use it, you need to follow it with the command you want described

Absolute vs relative paths
	absolute tells you in exact terms where you are, while relative is relative you where you are currently
		cd Desktop (relative) or cd /Users/Sal/Desktop (absolute)
		can do partial absolute for a more specific relative but must start with the directory you are in


Windows specific stuff
	Use terminal through Ubuntu being ran on windows
	files are saved and manipulated through a hidden file dealing with Ubuntu
	explorer.exe . allows you to interact directly with the linux folders in file explorer

	if you want to interact with windows folder in the linux terminal, you need to go backwards to the root 	directory and go into the mnt folder
	
	should save things you want to manipulate in the linux folders, to make it easier to navigate

Creating files and folders
	mkdir - make directory in current folder (ex. mkdir fish makles folder fish in current folder)
		try to avoid using spaces, as spaces seperate multiple files if you try to make multiple directories
		if you absolutely need one, need to use quotes
	
	touch - similiar to mkdir, but creates files instead
		same method, but need .(filetype) at end of name
		also changes modification time of file if it already exists

	cat - prints content of file in the terminal

	echo - writes text to the terminal, but with redirects (>) can put output into a file
	       can only do one piece of text, if you do it again it will replace previously echoed content
	       echo "Whaddup" > camel.txt

Removing/moving Files and Folders
	rm - permanently removes files and directories from computer **DOES NOT GO IN TRASH**
	     won't work if directory has content in it
			to bypass, rm -rf will delete directory and everything in it
	rmdir - same, but for empty directories
	        is safer if you want to be catious about deleting directories with things in them
		
	
	mv - moves files and folders
	     input mv, what you want to move, and the destination (can be relative or absolute path)
	     	mv file .. - moves specific file up
	     if the destination does not exist, it will rename the file instead
	     	can also move and rename at the same time
			mv file ../newnamefile

	cp - copy file and empty folder
	     similiar to mv, can also rename things
	     to copy folder with contents, need to add -r flag
